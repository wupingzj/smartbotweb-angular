# SAAS tool to manage a smart chatbot

This project aims to create a web tool for user to create a chatbot with smarts instead of a dumb chatbot.

Angular Material is used as the main UI compenent library in this project.

This project demonstrates 
- routing/navigation
- query parameter passing
- parent/child page data passing
- UI component composing
- service call to backend
- usage of Angular Material

`To Do`: add a screenshot here

`Note:` to allow this web site run standalone as a demo without the prerequisite of the backend services running, the data of service calls are mocked.
